Approach: Using Temporary or External Hosting
1. Direct Upload to Video Hosting Services
Use services like Cloudinary, Vimeo, YouTube, or Streamable to generate playable links for uploaded videos.
The video is uploaded directly from the user's device to the third-party service without being stored on your server.
How It Works:

Users upload videos via a file input on your website.
The file is directly sent to the external hosting service using their API.
Once uploaded, the service returns a playable video link (e.g., https://video-host.com/abc123), which you can display to the user.
Examples:

Cloudinary API:
Use their unsigned upload feature for free-tier video hosting.
Cloudinary Docs
Vimeo API:
Generate playback links via Vimeo's API.
Vimeo Docs
2. Stream-Only Uploads
Some services allow stream-only uploads, where users can stream videos without permanent storage:

Mux: Converts uploaded videos into streaming-ready links without requiring you to store files locally.
Streamable: Simplifies video streaming by generating links for uploaded videos.
3. File Transfer Services for Temporary Links
If permanent hosting isn't required, use file transfer services to create temporary links:

WeTransfer API or File.io: These services allow users to upload files and generate shareable links. The files are automatically deleted after a specified time.
Implementation Steps
Front-End:
Add a file upload form on your website.
Use JavaScript to upload the file directly to the external service (via their SDK or API).
Back-End (Optional):
Use a server-side API to manage authentication keys or validate uploads (if required by the hosting service).
Return the generated link to the front end for playback.
Playback:
Use a video player like Video.js or an <iframe> for embedding the video link.
Validate the video link before displaying it.
Advantages
No Storage Costs: Videos are hosted on third-party platforms.
Scalability: Handle large files and high traffic without overloading your server.
Speed: Most services optimize videos for playback automatically.
Example with Cloudinary
Here’s how you can integrate Cloudinary for direct video uploads:

Set Up Cloudinary:

Create a free account at Cloudinary.
Get your API key and configure upload presets for unsigned uploads.
Front-End Code (Using JavaScript):

const uploadVideo = async (file) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('upload_preset', 'your_preset_name'); // Replace with your preset name.

  const response = await fetch('https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/your_cloud_name/video/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Uploaded Video URL:', data.secure_url);
  // Display or use the generated link
};

document.getElementById('videoInput').addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  uploadVideo(file);
});
Back-End (Optional): Use a server to handle signed upload requests for better security.

Important Considerations
Bandwidth Costs: Depending on the service, streaming may incur bandwidth costs (check free tier limits).
Privacy: Ensure user-uploaded videos comply with privacy and copyright policies.
Rate Limits: Free tiers often have limits on the number of uploads or bandwidth.

Step 2: Front-End Implementation
File Upload Form
Add an input form to accept video files:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Video Streaming App</title>
  <script defer src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Upload Your Video</h1>
  <input type="file" id="videoInput" accept="video/*">
  <p id="uploadStatus"></p>
  <div id="videoPlayer"></div>
</body>
</html>
JavaScript Logic
Handle file uploads and generate a video link:

const CLOUDINARY_URL = 'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<your_cloud_name>/video/upload';
const UPLOAD_PRESET = '<your_upload_preset>';

document.getElementById('videoInput').addEventListener('change', async (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('upload_preset', UPLOAD_PRESET);

  try {
    document.getElementById('uploadStatus').innerText = 'Uploading...';
    const response = await fetch(CLOUDINARY_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const videoUrl = data.secure_url;

    document.getElementById('uploadStatus').innerText = 'Upload Complete!';
    document.getElementById('videoPlayer').innerHTML = `
      <video controls width="600">
        <source src="${videoUrl}" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
    `;
  } catch (err) {
    document.getElementById('uploadStatus').innerText = 'Error uploading video!';
    console.error(err);
  }
});
Step 3: Optional Back-End for Secure API Key Handling
Install Node.js and Express:
npm install express body-parser cors
Create a server to handle secure API calls:
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  // Handle secure API calls for upload (Optional)
});

const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
How It Works
The user selects a video file.
The file is uploaded directly to Cloudinary via their API.
A playable link is generated and displayed on the app.

document.getElementById('saveLinkButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(DATABASE_API, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ video_url: videoUrl, user_id: 'user123' }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.success) {
      alert('Link saved successfully!');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error saving link:', err);
  }
});
Step 4: Back-End for Saving Links
Node.js Example
Install dependencies:
npm install express body-parser cors pg
Create a server:
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());

const pool = new Pool({
  user: '<your_db_user>',
  host: '<your_db_host>',
  database: '<your_db_name>',
  password: '<your_db_password>',
  port: 5432,
});

app.post('/save-link', async (req, res) => {
  const { video_url, user_id } = req.body;

  try {
    const result = await pool.query(
      'INSERT INTO video_links (video_url, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2) RETURNING *',
      [video_url, user_id]
    );
    res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: result.rows[0] });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server running on port 5000'));
How It Works
Users upload videos, and a playable link is generated.
Users can click the "Save Link" button to store the link in the database.
Saved links can be retrieved later via database queries.
Future Enhancements
Add user authentication for personalized link management.
Display a list of saved links on a user dashboard.
Implement search and filtering for saved links.
